### Hargray WEB DEVELOPER CODE TEST
Now that we have had our interview and we did a mini code review and discussion.  Please go back to your project and refactor the code based on our conversation.  Donâ€™t add any new dictionaries but refactor in such a way that you could easily add a new dictionary if required.  The goal of this exercise is to see how you adapt to the feedback from the code review and how that affects your ability to refactor.
# 
Assuming each API endpoint returns different JSON, we can create different service objects to parse each differently. Based on the form used, the HTTP verb will trigger a different controller action utilizing different
service objects

# Reflection: 
This was a fun exercise in consuming a 3rd party API. I appreciate the clear guidelines & flexilibity in developer discretion. 

# Planning: 
-Rails setup scaled through commands like 'rails new app' & 'rails generate controller XYZ' 
-I made 2 views pages to keep it simple, a root index a.k.a landing page and a search result page 
-Setup routes to reflect the root page and redirects
-Added simple bootstrap in the asset pipeline to make it appear simple and nice 
-I used gems like RestClient & JSON to send the request and parse the response 
-Gem figaro was to hide the API key & ID in a safe place in the directory, and goes in the .gitignore so it doesn't get uploaded to the internet while using version control 
-After submission of a search term, the definition (or error) would be displayed to the user alongside a search history of words (max: 5 words)  
-Exception handling was done with begin/rescue/end block alongside a rails baked render_404 method setup in the parent application controller.  These exception handling blocks then handled logging the errors in both technical terms & human terms so developers could see and understand error details, parameters, and the response object while the user received a readable-message stating any reason for a error

# Additional takeaways
-The hardest part was actually parsing the response object from the Oxford API. I have worked with deep nested data (ex. Fast JSONAPI) so I was able to use tools like Postman & byebug to cleanly parse it. (sidenote: I was blown away by the amount of academic information there was for each word)
-I used the Ruby array method .last() to handle only displaying last 5 search terms. Refreshing to see again all the dynamic array methods Ruby allows
